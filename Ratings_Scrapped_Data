I've heard that this laptop heats up really quickly, but I didn't felt any thing like that. This laptop never reaches more than 10 degrees above my room temperature, even after I game on it for 4 hours. This can run mostly all games on high setting with 60 fps. I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valor...",5

First impression is very good..

Machine is too good in performance that I want.",5

3. PERFORMANCE - Fast startup, no lagging as of now while using softwares like AutoCAD, Adobe suite.
4. RAM - 8GB ram is good, but reco...",4

RTX 3060 is a MaxQ design, and it needs to be shown in the title. But do not worry, it might be a big low performer compared to non-MaxQ, but it is still faster than the RTX 2060 desktop version.

Processor boosts to 4.3GHz, with a huge temperature, to avoid this, I would suggest you clock down and adjust the voltages.

This really is best laptop in this price segment. 10500h and rtx 3060 at 93k is really overwhelming.

First we have to praise the looks, the black beauty with the red accented keys and the red Backlit led is beyond sexy.
Even the cutouts for fan vents are beautifully done.
All the ports you need that includes 2 USB 3.0s, 2 USB C, 1 HDMI, 1 RJ45 and a Golden headphone jack port.

A decent laptop with awesome performance and when put on battery saver mode manually in settings it will last upto 3hours. I'm an engineering student who casually play power hungry games, so for me having an rtx gpu.is really an advantage.

1268,"Initial thoughts :
*The system is smooth and steady .
*Not very colour accurate screen tho it's it's excellent for the price .
*144 hz does helps in browsing etc .
But i can clearly see the places where the software isn't optimised for 144hz refresh rate .
* Run a few game - highly recommend to upgrade the ram to 16 or 32 for better gaming .
**No web cam .",5

2572,"Initial thoughts :
*The system is smooth and steady .
*Not very colour accurate screen tho it's it's excellent for the price .
*144 hz does helps in browsing etc .
But i can clearly see the places where the software isn't optimised for 144hz refresh rate .
* Run a few game - highly recommend to upgrade the ram to 16 or 32 for better gaming .
**No web cam .",5
2573,In this price range you will get many laptops but this is best . Because :- 512gb ssd comes with 8 gb of ram and 4gb graphics card ssd and ram card is expendable . Rgb light is looking fantastic 😍.....after many research and review I will brought this product. It comes with ryzen 7 4800h its far better then Intel core i7 its provide excellent quality of super smooth performance . Go for it it's the beast. Thanks ASUS Team for this product. And bunch of thanks to flipkart team 👍👍,5

The requirement was to get something light, Minimalistic and powerful enough to play latest AAA titles. Another factor was the battery life. I wanted something which should last atleast 6+hrs.

3294,"I'm writing this review after 48hrs of use. I'm not promoting the sale of company. This is the honest one I'm writing which I found after the use.

pros:-
1. Heart rate & spo2 sensor are 85%-90% accurate(improvement needed
2. By switch into a sports mode it can give a better result if the watch is connected to your phone and your phone gps is on.
3. sleep tracking is also good but can be better by improving the algorithm & software. its 75% accurate.
4. Built quality, colour saturation is up ...",4
3295,Battery life is excellent. Display is big and nice. Real me link app is great. Spo2 works well. Notification also works well. Overall best in this price range.,4

5091,The 1st impression and looks arr so good. Facing connectivity issue with Noisefit app. Noise have to improve their App features. Another major issue is Battery. They are telling 10 days Battery back up. I expected atleast 7 days. But ita very poor. With in 24 hours more than 40% charge down. This is the 2nd I am using this.

I personally own the Apple Watch Series 5 but this watch has its own Magic and Aura!

Active 2 is much sharper in terms of display and gives more range of exercises, a few that the watch tracks manually!
It’s new gesture to switch functions is marvellous and gives a Haptic Touch feel that is so soothing thanks to its latest technology!

Will highly recommend it. If there was any option to add additional standby face wallpapers it would have been better. Currently I just got 4-5 options.,5

Good health tracking and excercise features. The training course is awesome. I had used honor band 3, hence know the accuracy and detail of sleep monitor, its on par. Call receive, music and battery are boon.

5521,"Worth the price..
Best thing is the display and elegant design.
Looks good on large wrist..
Surprisingly calling function is good enough to talk indoor.. I didn't notice any distortion in voice..
Operating system is somewhat sluggish but that's what you get with this price range.. And it's manageable..
Lag of 2-3 seconds in notifications compared to phone..
No option for quick reply..

Watch faces are there but n...",5
5522,"⚫The best part about this watch is its display and its calling feature.
⚫Though the speaker is not loud enough to take calls in outdoor but works pretty well in indoors.
⚫Battery is pretty decent and would last for about 8 days on moderate usage.

5525,"Great watch...
10+ days of battery backup.
I have Huawei GT as well and that's when I was in love with this watch. Previously had Amazfit Pace which was OK but screen had limitations.
With amoled Honor watch is amazing, using it for tracking steps calories for daily game of badminton.
On the side note I'm official designer of Huawei watchface.. Attached are some of designs I'm testing currently. India republic day face won't be allowed online as Huawei does not allow county flag.",4
5526,"The overall look of the watch is good, dial is awesome strap I don't like much. All the health related features works fine, my personal favourite is sleep monitor. It gives stand by time of 20min, lots of watch faces but half of them you won't go na like. Notification is limits by the text, whatsapp notification of groups don't show name of sender. I can say that watch is good at the price range. As far as I watch or samsung gear which are costly.",4

Here are some findings after using the product for over 7 months now.
Battery- Easily lasts for 2 days with 5% still to spare. Mind you I had done a 5Km walk climbed multiple stairs i these two days.

6089,"My First Apple Watch!!! Simply Amazing.
I used to wear China smartwatch earlier but I never felt anything like what I feel after wearing Apple Watch. It’s original and superb.
The heart rate monitor is super accurate.
Best part is that you simply can access all your notifications in your apple watch which means you don’t need to remove your cell from pocket again and again. You can reply to any messages in your watch itself and also it shows suggestions of auto replies which I feel is best....",5

Since, there is no STREET VIEW AND ROUTING by using GPS in Apple maps team can give access to use Google maps until Apple maps get ready. otherwise it is a little disappointment for apple watch series 3 GPS users like me in India.

6522,The best smart watch you can get from Apple in this price. If this is your first apple watch then it’s the best choice. Worth buying this.❤️,5
6523,Nothing is better than apple apart from watch flipkart delivered it for 12 days and the package improvement should be taken when we are buying for worthy products simply package and its better product go for it rather than 3,5
6524,"Outstanding
In simple words, what you’re expect that will you get from apple.
Such an amazing device, running smoothly and fast.
If your heart is in good condition, I mean if you don’t need an ECG option, then you definitely go for it without any thinking. Worth buying !

Thank you Flipkart for such a good deal, and a great service. ..",5
6525,"I am using it since 3 weeks and am in love with it.
It is beautiful and with some great features
I dont need to hold the phone all time and my workouts are well tracked. I can take calls, listen to music, workout and check all the notifications on the watch. Too good",5

I usually wasn’t a fan of the so called smart watches until I hopped on to this beast! My budget was limited, series 3 was a decade old, 6 was out of reach and therefore I landed into SE which happened to be a perfect balance. The battery life obviously is downside of any Apple Watch but the they sync with your phone is unprecedented.

6857,I got this for 4860 in flipkart BBD. For this price I guarantee you this is the best product for activity tracking. Best design with well built quality. If you are looking for smart watch type i would only rate this product 4. But if you are looking for best fitness watch i would give it 4.5 because the trackings are so accurate. For this price i would definitely recommend it.,4

Battery - as expected lasts 7-10 days considering all activated features, charging is fast using magnetic charger. Built quality is matchless. Looks, design and fit is superb.

7848,please don't go for versa 3. The watch software is very sluggish for a product at this price point. the swipes are slow and certain watch faces make it too slow. often the watch fails to sync with its phone app and even repeated attempts to manually sync too is impossible.,1

Good fitness and sleep tracking. Looks gorgeous.
Only qualm is Fitbit Pay, hope it gets approved.
This is a good smartwatch for those who want health features. You are attaching a hardware to your body almost 24x7. So don't buy a cheap watch which can cause more issues. Better to go for something which is reputed, or don't buy at all.",5

If you are okay with silicone buds then go for Bassheadset 103. Its audio quality is better than Basshead 104. I also have 103 model with me.

Do not expect lot of bass in these two models, bass effect is very little. If you are not a bass lover, model 103 would suit you well.",4

12407,"Pure awesomeness from Ambrane. Deep bass notes, absolutely stunning battery backup and looks totally premium for an earbud I had paid Rs.900. At this price point, this is one of the best earbud in the market. Strongly recommend. Call quality is perhaps the only point it scores a little less. I don't play games so cant really comment on lag. If you're in for music pleasure, this product will sail your mind.",5

Problems I'm facing

1. Buds don't charge while you charge ur case.
This means once u charge ur case, u have to again leave ur buds and case for the buds to get charged.

2. No charging indicator for the case.

3. Bass boost and dynamic modes in the realme link app are not good.

Apart from those above, the sound quality, design, battery backup, passive noise cancellation, fitting are excellent and very very much appreciated at this price.

Problems I'm facing

1. Buds don't charge while you charge ur case.
This means once u charge ur case, u have to again leave ur buds and case for the buds to get charged.

2. No charging indicator for the case.

3. Bass boost and dynamic modes in the realme link app are not good.

1- The backup is only 2 to 3 Hrs on Play mode with normal volume and Standby is not more than 12 Hrs.

14706,"My honest assessment. The product is ok ok type not a very good battery backup. Design is great
The biggest disadvantages I found is that there is no clear indication wheathe it's on or off. Sometimes needs long press to onnor off. Buttons are little harder to push.
So no diplomatic statement, Boult need to rectify these points otherwise a good option in this range & yes once again the design is good",3
14707,Reviewing after 15 days of use. battery back up to 2 to 3 days as mentioned. Bass is superb and good clarity of output but some extra bass lovers need little more.

14821,"It is a good product. I was purchased it on 22nd July 2019, and i didn't got a single problem. I works perfectly. Good sound quality and battery capacity. Good product from Boult audio.",5
14822,"Very nice product.... The design and the sound quality is superb and at the price which I got it was real amazing
Pros:
1. Sound Quality
2. Design
3. Price
4. Built Quality
5. Battery back up
Cons:
1. The bass could be improved",5
14823,"Its a Very Nice Product.. value for money... Have been using from last 6 moths.. Battery backup is awsome.
Sound qaulity is best in class.. loved the procduct..",5
14824,I had a great experience so far. The voice is clear and range is good as well. The battery life is 18 - 24 hrs after full charge.,5
14825,"Boult's sound quality better than Boat. This has perfect balance of treble and base, bass is perfect, not like Boat where you only hear bass and no lyrics when it gets loud.

If I give Boult headphone a 9 out of 10 then I will give Boat headphone 6 out of 10.

You decide!!",5
14826,Not the most fashionable of headsets that one can get but the price justifies that. At first I felt that the sound wasn't punchy at all so I ended up changing the tips which I recomment to find the perfect fit. Once that was done the sound produced by these was ample. The range wasn't exactly a problem for me. I cannot really comment that as for me it was sufficient. The battery backup is better than what someone would need. I never found these running out of charge.,5

14828,"I like the design and build quality with good sound and bass, and the most important is battery backup is most powerful of this device better than other Bluetooth headsets.",5

14840,"A decent headset for calls and videos/movies, but not good enough for music. Only SBC is supported, but that's ok at this price. The overall frequency response is far from flat and does not result in a natural or neutral sound. Still it is ok for calls and watching videos.",3
14841,"Hii Dear , your product is very good and sound clearly .boult audio is the best ...thanq boult",5
14842,"The battery backup is about 8-9 hrs. Sound quality is sexy but not so good for bass lover. Overall,it's worth buying. Just go for it. Better than boat rockerzz as my personal opinion. Boult do give option for skipping and previous song by using only volume buttons. Doesn't vibrate for calls.
Overall- buy it 😘😘",5
14843,100 percent genuine product . Good sound quality worth for the price . Best option to buy under 1500 Rs,5
14844,"First of all it was an excellent product. If you are looking for a good quality product then you can choose this one as it's sound and bass are very good.
Only problem is with the Bluetooth connectivity sometimes it's is automatically disconnecting and sometimes hard to connect even.

But on the whole it's an excellent product you can go for especially for music lovers. The battery backup is excellent too.",4
14845,"One month review. Battery life is great as compared to similar products of similar price. Sound is decent. Great for regular use.
Con: Bass is not good. My wired boat earphones (Rs 400 something ones) has better bass than this.",4
14846,"Not like the previous version of Boult. I loved that product and when I broke the previous one I ordered the same because I liked that model because of its battery backup and vibration features.
This version doesn't come with vibration which is a major drawback. For travelling person like me without vibration I couldn't know if someone's calling me or not unless I keep the headset 24/7 in my ears. The battery is also not upto the mark like the previous one. Not worth the money",3
14847,"I used 30 days.....and my opinion it's sound quality so clear and comfortable and bass quality balanced,in this range...so,i clearly talk to all buyers in this price range it's good not awesome because sound quality and bass quality good but build quality not expected.thank you",5
14848,"I am using this for few months. I bought it for 999 and I would say this is best for the price i paid.
Best part is battery vack up. I am charging one 2-3 days with continuous usage. It goes on standby mode when disconnected.

Battery backup : Best
Sound quality : best in this category",5
14849,"I would like to appreciate the Flipkart's delivery service. I got my product in less than 24 hours!
This device is a value for money. Its hard to get such crisp sound quality at such low budget in Bluetooth earphones available at the market. Bass is best in class, sound quality is good and the fitting in the ear is comfortable and not loose. You can wear it for hours without complaint of pain in ears. Excellent product... Would recommend it!",5
14850,"Sound quality in these earphones are amazing .the mids are crisp and clear,the vocals also good the bass is also high.the call quality also very good",5
14851,All good except connectivity.. As shown in specification.. Bluetooth connectivity is not more than 10-12 feets... But same is also for boat rockerz too So no comparision. But as compared to Boat Rockers noise cancellation works good in BOULT. Overall good 😍😍,5
14852,"For the price the product is a decent one.
The build quality is just fine.
Sound is good for deep bass as indian users like.
With the adjustable headphone loop is one of a kind and quite handy.",4
14853,"The earphones are great. Once pairing is done, it only takes a second or two to connect each time. Sound quality is good and bass is really nice. Pricing is good given the quality of the product. The neck band is comfortable and the earbuds won't hurt even after long hours of use. Overall I would give it a 4/5 rating.",4
14854,"Awesome bluetooth headset.sound quality is no doubt very good under the price bucket.very handy and easy to wear around neck.Best part of the headset is battery backup.I have used multiple bluetooth headset,never come a single headset which can compete this one.2 days backup after medium usage.",5
14855,"This was a good buy. I searched many times on youtube and flipcurt about it's review, and then decide to buy. It's really god at affordable price. It's really doing well. Sound is also really good, with the extra bass as it says. All in compact way. Thank you Asian flipcurt",4

The battery backup works just fine for all the working peeps who wouldn't be able to charge the device every now and then. The magnetised buds make the manageability easier.

Still good for a budget type of thing..",4

15202,It was awesome for this price as we cannot expect more in this price range. The sound quality is okay and at high volume the music gets muddy but it works fine at medium and low volume levels. the design is actually very comfortably but still it feels much cheap on a closer look(though looks fine for the price). Bass is descent just enough I guess. The battery backup is actually good it last almost a day for me with an avg use. Would recommend buying it,4

I was little confused while buying Boult Bluetooth headset because other side there were many popular brands in Bluetooth headset were charging for ₹2100-₹3500.
I was having low budget though I invested my money to buy Boult headset but when I received my product it is damn fantastic in its quality.

Honest review: Never seen anything like this before. You can trust this product. Highly recommended.
For this price range, I believe this is the best rival of Boat 255 series. I had Sennheiser 180 cxII before and thought I would never find any earphone like this, had been my personal favorite. But though being wireless, this earphone won my heart. Close to Sennheiser I would say.
Bass- Good
Treble- Balanced
High and mids are clear upto 90% volume (I recommend this level)",5

The earpieces are too flimsy. The left one came apart but luckily i was able to put it back together again. I also ha...,3

I bought this in sale @899

Sound quality is very nice and bass is ok. You can enable bass boost in PC or in mobile to boost bass effect. According to pricing I think its nice and worth it.

But It starts paining in my ears if I use them continuously for 2 hours. I guess the buds are not comfortable for long time use.

Battery backup is nice and it lasts nearly 12 hrs. That's the main reason I bought this product.

These are still the most affordable b...",4

18025,"Putting my review after 10 days of purchase. I found this bud as expected. The sound quality is great with an amazing bass quality. One would love hearing music in low sound too, It's soothing. The only problem is in design and fitness. But in days you will be used to it. Overall good to go and worthy product by One Plus. Easy to connect, once you open the bud it gets automatically connected within 3-4 secs.",5
18026,Awesome buds! I'm not happy with 2 points- it's quite big and got irritation to keep that ear for longer time. Could be since it is new.. Need few days to get used to it! Battery.. not that great I believe.. Should wait n watch . Works smoothly with OnePlus mobiles.,5
18027,Wonderful sound Quality am impressed sounds clear . Bass was very good.but when calling indoor in good when comes outdoor it's very bad.,4
18028,"Just wish it fits your ear for jogging or running.
Other than that everything is perfectly amazing.
Connection: connected very easily to my oneplus 8 and laptop.
Sound: perfect
Noise cancellation: Not the best there is, but it is enough
Mic: i really thought this would be bad, since its quite far from the mouth, but there was absolutely no noise(with clear voice) in attending meetings and calls.",5
18029,"Just loved the product. Works seamlessly. I wanted it to connect to my laptop to attend meetings. Looks sturdy as I dropped them but they still work. Lol.

18030,Superb quality most beautiful design and tqq uhh one Plus for made this best products for us 😍✌️ So much happy I said to one Plus user buy this Buds most best for us♥️✌️,3
18031,The sound quality was very clear and you can hear all minute sounds while watching hd or 4k content. Bass is adequate and decent level but not that much loud who loves more sound. Comfort level was superb I don't realise after sometime whether something I has in my ear. Fit on ear is very perfect atleast for me and I believe it vary person to person depends on their ear. Overall all good buy for this price.,3
18032,"* Fastest Delivery
* Perfect Sound Quality
* I would like give 4 out of 5 rating for Bass
* Earbuds fitting slightly loose for me .But it's depends on the user .
* If you are Oneplus user than connectivity is very fast .
* For OnePlus User you will get the more functionality with the Touch.
* Based on the Price range OnePlus earbuds is worth it .",3
18033,"I quite liked the buds. It gives u a balanced experience.

18034,"Pros👍🏻
1. Premium built quality
2. Audio quality is good during phone call... It actually reduces background noise and picks up only the voice which is nice.

Otherwise it is a great product for its price.",3

And before this router i was using a TP Link singal band router. The signal of that router was so strong i could use that from the street ( I'm not kidding here).

My experience with this router is horrible. I g...",1
19442,"OK. I had searched for so many answers but didn't get it all answered even after going through all the reviews. Anyways bought this Dir819 unit in Aug 2019. I'll try to answer all questions I was looking for, maybe it'll hep others. Also I went for this model specifically since it had both 2.4Ghz (more penetration thru walls) and 5Ghz (higher speed) antennas

19443,"It is a very good router. The range is good for 2.4 GHz. The 5 GHz have a low range but it is normal with 5 GHz. The only problem I found out is that if we are using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz at same time on different devices, the one with 5 GHz isn't fast enough i.e. the bandwidth distribution between both the bands doesn't seem equal. Otherwise it is a great product for its price.",3
19444,"Since last 10 years I was using the net gear n150 which is my first router. As my fire stick was not giving good performance with net gear. I planned to go for this one as this is a dual band supports 5 GHz.

After connecting this beauty, I realised net gear has done its job & this is a beast of a router which is giving me a unparalleled & no loss connectivity at both 2.4 & 5 GHz range.

Just go for it. I love this product.",5

One important Note that this router is Version 3 , It has 4 x 6dbi antennas and power adapter DC output is 9V 1A .

19469,Wonderful experience so far.This provides more than enough coverage for a small home or a normal flat / apartment as long as you place it properly in the middle of the house. File transfers in the home network maxes out around 400Mbps( in the 5gig band) so far in my tests. USB file sharing also works seamlessly as long as you are using a Windows laptop/PC. Since it comes with an option to wall mount it saves some space for you too.,5

Its a very amazing product... quality at its best... D-link is always been a trusted brand for years.
- high quality device
- complete accuracy
- no latency
- no connection drop
- hassle free device, no more worried of turning router On and Off like other device.

20044,"Just 2 days used - amazing performance!! Hope initially all new products will sound good.. Need to wait for few months to check for the performance!! Will keep post the update about the performance..

Works great with top speed!!
